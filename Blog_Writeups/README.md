## 🔍 Overview  
In this blog post, I used various data science techniques to predict the earnings of photographers in London. The project involves using real-world data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a regression model to forecast photographers' income based on multiple factors.

### Key Topics Covered:  
- **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant datasets  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering hidden patterns in the data  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from raw data  
- **Model Building**: Training a predictive model using regression  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance
